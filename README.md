# Bookface

Bookface is main component of my [Senior Project](http://jordanosterberg.me/assets/Jordan%20Osterberg%20Senior%20Project.pdf) presentation.

There are two projects in this repository, server and client. The server is written in JavaScript (NodeJS). The client uses React and JSX.

## Server
To run the server, 
  1. Install a NodeJS process manager like pm2 or forever (either of these tools are great, I prefer and use pm2 for production!)
  2. Run index.js
  
## Client
To run the client,
  1. Run ```npm start``` in bookfaceclient's directory to run a local copy of the React app.
  
***Do not deploy bookface to your own servers. If you would like to view the live application, visit https://bookface.network.***

## Research Question

If you would like to know more about my Senior Project, you can read a copy [here](http://jordanosterberg.me/assets/Jordan%20Osterberg%20Senior%20Project.pdf). To summarzie, my research question was "Should the U.S. government regulate companiesâ€™ data collection like the GDPR in the E.U.?". Bookface was used to help present these ideas to my class. By showing the class how companies track your data, and how GDPR gives them control over that data (the ability to delete it, in context of the site), I was able to illustrate the need for data regulation in the technology industry.
